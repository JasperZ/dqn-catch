# Overview
This is a simple implementation of a catch game in a grid environment. To complete
the game the agent has to move from the start position to the target position.

# Agent
The agent is a simple deep q-learning implementation in tensorflow. It optionally
uses a separate target network for more stable learning from experience replay.
